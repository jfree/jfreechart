DateAxis, the equals() method in the AreaRenderer class, hardcoded outline 
attributes in the XYBubbleRenderer, and potential NullPointerExceptions in the
ChartPanel class.


JFreeChart 1.0.2:
-----------------
Released on 25 August 2006.

API adjustments:

The following adjustments have been made to the API (there should be no 
breakage of applications coded to the 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 API):

- CategoryToPieDataset: added accessor methods for underlying dataset, extract
    type and index (feature request 1477915);
- DefaultXYDataset:  New dataset implementation that uses double[] arrays;

    aggregatedItemsPaint, plus accessor methods - see bug 1190647;
- SpiderWebPlot:  Added new fields toolTipGenerator and urlGenerator, plus 
    accessor methods (see patch 1463455);

- XYPolygonAnnotation: Added new accessor methods.

Patches:

1459313 - Add renderAsPercentages option to StackedBarRenderer3D;
1462727 - Modify SpiderWebPlot to support zero values;

  XYStepAreaRenderer and TimeSeriesURLGenerator to call dataset methods that 
  return double primitive only;
- Updated XYPolygonAnnotation, adding new accessor methods and fixing problems
  in the equals()/hashCode() methods;
- ChartFactory.createStackedXYAreaChart() now uses StackedXYAreaRenderer2, for
  better handling of negative values;
- Added crosshair support for XYBarRenderer.

Experimental Code:

In this release, some new (incomplete) classes have been included in the 
org.jfree.experimental.* namespace.  These classes are not part of the 
standard API, but are included for developers to experiment with and provide
feedback on.  Hopefully in the future, refined versions of these classes will
be incorporated into the main library.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE API FOR THESE
CLASSES IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. 


JFreeChart 1.0.1:
----------------
Released 27 January 2006.  This is primarily a bug fix release.  In addition,
there are some API adjustments (there should be no breakage of applications 
coded to the 1.0.0 API).

API adjustments:
- BarRenderer: added a new flag (includeBaseInRange), plus accessor 
    methods, that controls whether or not the base value for the bar is 
    included in the range calculated by the findRangeBounds() method;
- BubbleXYItemLabelGenerator: new class;
- Range: added a new method expandToInclude(Range, double), this is used by 
    the BarRenderer class;
- TaskSeriesCollection: added two new methods, getSeries(int) and 
    getSeries(Comparable).
- TimeSeriesCollection:  the domainIsPointsInTime flag has been deprecated.  
    The flag serves no function now that renderers are used to calculate the 
    domain bounds, so you can safely delete any calls to the
    setDomainIsPointsInTime() method;
- XYPlot: added a new getAnnotations() method;
- XYSeries: the update(int, Number) method has been deprecated and a new method
    updateByIndex(int, Number) has been added;

Bug fixes:

1243050 - XYBarRenderer doesn't show entire range of values for a 
          TimeSeriesCollection;
1373371 - XYBubbleRenderer doesn't support item labels;
1374222 - BarRenderer contains JDK 1.4 specific code;
1374328 - LegendItem serialization problem;
1377239 - Bad argument checking in Quarter constructor;
1379331 - Incorrect drawing of TextTitle at LEFT or RIGHT position;
1386328 - RingPlot entity incorrect;
1400442 - Inconsistent treatment of null and zero values in PiePlot;
1401856 - Bad rendering for non-zero base values in BarRenderer;
1403043 - NullPointerException in CategoryAxis;
1408904 - NumberAxis3D assumes CategoryPlot;
1415480 - XYTextAnnotation equals() method doesn't check (x, y);
