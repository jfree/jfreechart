##### Version 1.0.13 (17-Apr-2009)

> SPECIAL NOTICE:  There will be a birds-of-a-feather session for JFreeChart at this year's JavaOne conference in San Francisco.  The session is scheduled for 6.45pm to 7.35pm on Wednesday 3 June.                        

This release contains:

- updates to the `ChartPanel` class to support copying charts to the clipboard, 
  panning and mouse-wheel zooming, and an overlay mechanism that supports
  crosshairs;
- enhancements to the auto-range calculation for axes, providing the ability
  to use subranges only and also to skip hidden series;
- updates for many of the `CategoryItemRenderer` implementations to ensure that
  they respect the `seriesVisible` flags;
- an improvement to the `TimeSeries` class so that it is no longer necessary to
  specify the time period type in the constructor;
- a new `SamplingXYLineRenderer` for improving the performance of time series
  charts with large datasets;
- the `XYSeries/XYSeriesCollection` classes now cache the minimum and maximum
  data values to improve the performance of charts with large datasets;
- entities are now created for the chart, data area and axes, allowing mouse
  clicks to be detected for these regions;
- added a bar alignment factor to the `XYBarRenderer` class;
- a new `errorIndicatorStroke` field for the `StatisticalLineAndShapeRenderer` and `XYErrorRenderer` classes;
- added a new `HeatMapDataset` interface, `DefaultHeatMapDataset` implementation,
  and a `HeatMapUtilities` class to make it easier to create heat map charts;
- there is a new flag to allow an `XYDataImageAnnotation` to be included in the
  automatic range calculation for the axes;
- additional attributes in the `XYTextAnnotation` class;
- added a `sampleFunction2DToSeries()` method to the `DatasetUtilities` class;
- some changes to the `ChartPanel` class that help to work around a regression in
  JRE 1.6.0_10 relating to drawing in XOR mode.  Regarding this final point:
     * the default value for the `useBuffer` flag has changed to true, which means
       that all charts will, by default, be rendered into an off-screen image
       before being displayed in the `ChartPanel`;
     * the zoom rectangle is drawn using XOR mode *only* when the `useBuffer`
       flag has been set to false.
  For most usage, this should improve performance (but at the cost of using more
  memory for each `ChartPanel` used in your application);

###### Bug Fixes

- 2690293 : Problem with Javascript escape characters;
- 2617557 : `StandardDialScale` ignored `tickLabelPaint`;
- 2612649 : `Stroke` selection in plot property editor;
- 2583891 : `SWTGraphics2D.fillPolygon()` not implemented;
- 2564636 : `Month` constructor ignores Locale;
- 2502355 : `ChartPanel` sending multiple events;
- 2490803 : `PeriodAxis.setRange()` method doesn't take into account that the axis
          displays whole periods;

In addition, a bug in the `SlidingCategoryDataset` class has been fixed, the
correct outline paint is now used by `GradientXYBarPainter`, a new method
has been added to the `ImageMapUtilities` class to escape special characters
in Javascript strings to avoid problems with the OverLIB and DynamicDrive
tooltips, and there are some important fixes in the `LogAxis` class.

This release passes 2110 JUnit tests (0 failures) on JRE 1.6.0_12.

Note that the fix incorporated in the special JFreeChart 1.0.8a release was
flawed in that it broke the URLs in the HTML image maps generated by 
JFreeChart.  Further amendments have been made in this release to fix this 
problem.

          CombinedRangeXYPlot (these can all be drawn with a horizontal or
          vertical orientation);
        - Bill Kelemen has enhanced the DateAxis class to handle segmented
          timelines.  This can be used, for example, to skip weekends for
          daily stock price charts;
        - Richard Atkinson has updated the ServletUtilities class;
        - Bryan Scott has added an XYDatasetTableModel class for presenting
          datasets in a JTable;
        - modified XYPlot to allow renderers to use multiple passes through
          the dataset;
        - added new XYDifferenceRenderer;
        - added support for colored bands between gridlines in XYPlot;
        - added new XYDrawableAnnotation class;
        - added a new attribute to control the order of dataset rendering in
          a CategoryPlot;
        - extended the value label mechanism for the renderers, to allow
          better (per series) control over label generation, positioning and
          visibility;
        - CategoryItemTooltipGenerator has been renamed
          CategoryItemLabelGenerator, since it is now being used to generated
          item labels as well as tooltips;
        - there is now support for horizontal stacked 3D bar charts;
        - added support for range markers against secondary axis in a
          CategoryPlot;
        - added labels to domain and range markers;
        - added a new HistogramDataset class (contributed by Jelai Wang) to
          make it easier to create histograms with JFreeChart;
        - moved the DrawingSupplier into the plot class, renderers now
          reference the supplier from the plot (parent plot for combined and
          overlaid charts).  This means that renderers now share a single
          DrawingSupplier by default, which simplifies the creation of
          combined charts;
        - changed the ColorBarAxis classes that extended the NumberAxis class,
          to a single ColorBar class that wraps a ValueAxis (may have broken
          one or two things in the process);
        - Barak Naveh has contributed new classes MatrixSeries and
          MatrixSeriesCollection, along with demos:  BubblyBubblesDemo.java
          and BubblyBubblesDemo2.java;
        - the TextTitle class now has a background paint attribute;
        - the StandardLegend class now generates LegendEntity objects if a
          ChartRenderingInfo instance is supplied to the draw(...) method;
        - extended the CategoryTextAnnotation class to take into account a
          category anchor point.  See the SurveyResultsDemo.java application
          for an example;
        - included numerous bug fixes;

##### Version 0.9.8 (24-Apr-2003)
        - changed package naming from com.jrefinery.* to org.jfree.*;
        - added new TimePeriodValuesCollection class;
        - added MIME type code to ServletUtilities class;
        - reversed the order of PieDataset and KeyedValuesDataset in
          the class hierarchy;
        - reversed the order of CategoryDataset and KeyedValues2DDataset
          in the class hierarchy;
        - minor bug fixes;

##### Version 0.9.7 (11-Apr-2003)
        - added a new ValueDataset interface and DefaultValueDataset
          class, and changed the CompassPlot class to use this instead
          of MeterDataset;
        - added DataUtilities class, to support creation of Pareto
          charts (new demo included);
        - updated writeImageMap method as suggested by Xavier Poinsard
          (see Feature Request 688079);
        - implemented Serializable for most classes (this is likely to
          require further testing);
        - incorporated contour plot updates from David M. O'Donnell;
        - added new CategoryTextAnnotation and XYLineAnnotation
          classes;
        - added new HorizontalCategoryAxis3D class contributed by
          Klaus Rheinwald;

        Bug fixes:
        - added a workaround for JVM crash (a JDK bug) in pie charts
          with small sections (see bug report 620031);
        - fixed minor bug in HorizontalCategoryPlot constructor (see
          bug report 702248);
        - added code to ensure HorizontalNumberAxis3D is not drawn if
          it is not visible (see bug report 702466);
        - added small fix for suppressed chart change events (see bug
          report 690865);
        - added pieIndex parameter to tooltip and URL generators for
          pie charts;
        - fixed bug in getLastMillisecond() method for the Second
          class and the getFirstMillisecond() method for the Year
          class (picked up in JUnit tests);
        - in TextTitle, changed width used for relative spacing to fix
          bug 703050;

        - fixed null pointer exception in DefaultCategoryDataset;
        - fixed update problem for PaintTable, StrokeTable and
          ShapeTable objects;
        - added methods to control colors in PiePlot (these were
          inadvertantly removed in the changes made for 0.9.5);
        - fixed auto-range update problem for secondary axis;
        - fixed missing category labels in the overlaid category plot;
        - fixed constructors for symbolic axes;
        - corrected error in Javadoc generation (Ant script);

##### Version 0.9.5 (6-Feb-2003) 

PLEASE NOTE THAT MAJOR CHANGES TO THE
        JFREECHART API HAVE BEEN MADE IN THIS RELEASE!

        - added support for secondary axes, datasets and renderers;
        - added new data interfaces (Value, Values, Values2D,
          KeyedValues and KeyedValues2D) and incorporated these into
          the existing PieDataset and CategoryDataset interfaces.
        - modified the CategoryDataset interface to be more
          symmetrical, data is organised in rows and columns (as
          before) but can now be accessed by row/column index or
          row/column key.
        - added support for reading PieDatasets and CategoryDatasets
          from XML files.
        - created separate packages for the axes
          (com.jrefinery.chart.axis), plots (com.jrefinery.chart.plot)
          and renderers (com.jrefinery.chart.renderer).
        - series attributes (paint, outline paint, stroke and shape)
          are now controlled by the renderer classes using lookup
          tables.  Introduced the DrawingSupplier interface (and
          DefaultDrawingSupplier class) which is used to populate the
          lookup tables from a common source (necessary to coordinate
          complex combined charts).
        - the chart legend can now display shapes corresponding to
          series.
        - moved responsibility for category distribution to the
          CategoryAxis class, which tidies up the code in the
          CategoryPlot classes.
        - gridlines are now controlled by the CategoryPlot and XYPlot
          classes, not the axes (included in this change is the
          addition of gridlines for the CategoryPlot domain values).
        - changed the list of titles in the JFreeChart class to a
          title and a list of subtitles.
        - added new renderers for XYPlot (XYBubbleRenderer and
          YIntervalRenderer).
        - modified Gantt chart to display sub-tasks.
        - added ContourPlot class (still experimental) by David
          M. O'Donnell.
        - introduced new MovingAverage class.
        - ChartMouseEvent now includes source chart.
        - numerous bug fixes.
        - lots of Javadoc updates.

##### Version 0.9.4 (18-Oct-2002)  

Added a new stacked area chart (contributed by Dan
        Rivett) and a compass plot (contributed by Bryan Scott).  Updated
        the ThermometerPlot class. Added a new XYDotRenderer for scatter
        plots. Modified combined and overlaid plots to use the series colors
        specified in the sub plot rather than the parent plot (this makes it
        easier to align the colors in the legend).  Added Regression class
        for linear and power regressions.  BasicTimeSeries can now
        automatically drop "old" data.  Some clean-up work in the code for
        tooltips and the event listener mechanism.  Richard Atkinson has
        incorporated some useful extensions for servlets/JSP developers.

        Ran Checkstyle and corrected issues reported for most classes.
        Checkstyle is a free utility that you can download from:

            http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net

        Fixed bugs and updated documentation.

        API changes include:
        - added tickMarkPaint to Axis constructor (also affects
          subclasses);
        - added getLegendItems() to Plot, and deprecated
          getLegendItemLabels();
        - added getLegendItem(int) to XYItemRenderer and
          CategoryItemRenderer.
        - most 'protected' member variables have been changed to
          'private'.
